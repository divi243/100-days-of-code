# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 2nd 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started with this 100 days challenge by committing on twitter. Coded on hacker rank and completed one problem while understood the solution for another.

**Thoughts:** First problem was easy b
 i struggled with second problem which is of medium difficulty in hacker rank related to string manipulation.

### Day 1: August 3nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued Udemy course on java, tried writing code for encryption of a string by shifting of letters in a string by n number. Could not do decryption part, tried with simple shifting of letters to the right by n places using for loops. The original solution had usage of hashmap which was little challenging for  me nd took me 3 hours to figure out. Also solved yesterday's problem on my own,  need to make it efficient for longer data. It fails to execute during required time.

**Thoughts:** Took more time and felt little demotivated however i did not give up and finally found the solution.

### Day 2: August 4th 2020


**Today's Progress**: Solved string manipulation problem related to string validation in java. Udemy course, solved prime  number problem using arrays and sieveoferatosthenes method. 

**Thoughts:** good day of coding

**Link to work:** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/ refered this for understanding the method 
time -3 hours

### Day 3: August 5th 2020


**Today's Progress**: Learned about anagrams and tried to code for checking if two strings are anagrams of each other. Not  much progress with string manipulation, stuck with problem related to finding the longest common substring from two strings, test cases are failing. 

**Thoughts:** Slightly demotivated but will try again tomorrow

time -3 hours

Day 4: August 6th 2020
(delete me or comment me out)
Today's Progress: Good day of learning. Learned about hashmap while trying to solve common child problem using hashmaps, basic test cases are passing in hackerrank but there are some other cases failing, however i learned how to convert hashmap to string array and that we can use linkedhashmap to preserve the order. Solved special string problem.

Thoughts: A better day at coding, started with some interview questions eg asked by fb (udemy course)

Link to work: time - 4 hours
### Day 5: August 7th 2020


**Today's Progress**: Referred hacker rank solution for common child problem. Tried Array manipulation problem of hard level,  could not solve much.
**Thoughts:** Slightly demotivated but will try again tomorrow

**Link to work:**
time -half day.

Day 6 & 7: 
Today's Progress: was not keeping well,no work on coding part but tried learning git. compeleted all the levels in  learngitbanching.com
Thoughts: Positive, learned well.

Day 8: August 10th 2020

Today's Progress: Learned about Arrays, data type conversion,prefix summation algorithm. Tried to code for Array manipulation hard problem from hackerrank, was able to code with help of references but need to optimize the code - time complexity reducition.


### Day 9: August 11th 2020


**Today's Progress**: went throgh udemy course, interview questions. Related to amazon,facebook etc

**Thoughts:** Less code more reading.

### Day 10: August 12th 2020


**Today's Progress**: Read an article - how to prepare for an interview, very informative one. Revised sorting, merging of two lists.

**Thoughts:** less code more reading

time -3 hours

### Day 12: August 14th 2020


**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem in hackerrank - frequency queries 
**Thoughts:** learned about Lists and revisited hashmap that refreshed my knowledge on maps,lists and arraylist.

### Day 13: August 18th 2020
  More of reading and less productive - refer twitter post. Selenium theory and installation of eclipse selenium drivers.
  
  ### Day 14: August 19th 2020


**Today's Progress**: Tried recording test scripts using selenium IDE, installed webdrivers for chrome, selenium. wrote a scriptfor launching google.com however facing some issue with driver version that needs to be fixed 
**Thoughts:** slow day

time -1 hour

Day 15: August 25th 2020

Today's Progress : Learned about notion app to keep track of my tasks, a very useful app.Learned about testNG scripts annotations.
Read an article regarding the same.

### Day 16: August 26th 2020


**Today's Progress**: wrote a sampl script using testng framework, tested youtube home page elements and their text,learned abou testng annotation - depends on, we can execute a certain code only if the code on which it is dependent is executed or passed. example - we can check an application further only after logging into the app. so login test must pass for other tests to exect
**Thoughts:** learned about Lists and revisited hashmap that refreshed my knowledge on maps,lists and arraylist.

time -3 hours


### Day 17: August 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Wrote script from toolsqa,to launch a demo site identify it's title and length of its title. use of testng commands. I read about test ng and selenium webdriver again and explores
d notion app by creating notes and subnotes within the app.

Thoughts : A good day to recollect on my testing knowledge, i read and recollected few topics in testing. Successfully launched the demo site and learned well about some commands

Time -3 hours

### Day 19: September 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried hackerrank problem to count the number of distinct pairs in an array whose difference is a number "k". Was satisfied as i could solve it on my own, made use of for loops first to grab each element find difference then check if they satisfy the condition, if so increment count.

Day 20:September 3rd 2020

Today's Progress: Read articles on dev.to related to selenium, planned to test any one website each week using selenium and testNG. Wrote few testcases for website www.guru99.com, started with launching website checking title.

Thoughts: A new strategy feels good, a goal is set and that makes my path much clearer.

### Day 20: September 4th 2020

***Today's Progress**: Organized my notion notes, added new article for my blog writing related to selenium and testing. Added few more test cases for testing week 1 website - guru99 and executed the same. mostly worked on writing notes and testing. Learned about how to find elements using locators. Learned about list of webelements and how to access them. Wrote 4 positive test cases and updated the same in my notes

Thoughts: Productive day.
