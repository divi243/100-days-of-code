**Today's Progress**: Started with this 100 days challenge by committing on twitter. Coded on hacker rank and completed one problem while understood the solution for another.

**Thoughts:** First problem was easy b
 i struggled with second problem which is of medium difficulty in hacker rank related to string manipulation.

**Today's Progress**: Continued Udemy course on java, tried writing code for encryption of a string by shifting of letters in a string by n number. Could not do decryption part, tried with simple shifting of letters to the right by n places using for loops. The original solution had usage of hashmap which was little challenging for  me nd took me 3 hours to figure out. Also solved yesterday's problem on my own,  need to make it efficient for longer data. It fails to execute during required time.

**Thoughts:** Took more time and felt little demotivated however i did not give up and finally found the solution.

**Today's Progress**: Solved string manipulation problem related to string validation in java. Udemy course, solved prime  number problem using arrays and sieveoferatosthenes method. 

**Thoughts:** good day of coding

**Link to work:** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/ refered this for understanding the method 
time -3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Learned about anagrams and tried to code for checking if two strings are anagrams of each other. Not  much progress with string manipulation, stuck with problem related to finding the longest common substring from two strings, test cases are failing. 

**Thoughts:** Slightly demotivated but will try again tomorrow

Today's Progress: Good day of learning. Learned about hashmap while trying to solve common child problem using hashmaps, basic test cases are passing in hackerrank but there are some other cases failing, however i learned how to convert hashmap to string array and that we can use linkedhashmap to preserve the order. Solved special string problem.

Thoughts: A better day at coding, started with some interview questions eg asked by fb (udemy course)

Link to work: time - 4 hours
