**Today's Progress**: Continued Udemy course on java, tried writing code for encryption of a string by shifting of letters in a string by n number. Could not do decryption part, tried with simple shifting of letters to the right by n places using for loops. The original solution had usage of hashmap which was little challenging for  me nd took me 3 hours to figure out. Also solved yesterday's problem on my own,  need to make it efficient for longer data. It fails to execute during required time.

**Thoughts:** Took more time and felt little demotivated however i did not give up and finally found the solution.
